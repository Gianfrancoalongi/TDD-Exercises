Background:
	You are the hacker that is also the only and current it expert on the Firm.
	The company is ramping up and they need someone to help develop
	the sales department.
	One of the things the Sales people say they want it a discrepancy analyzer
	for their Record of Sales (ROS) files they get from their store managers. 

	You will write a quick PoC for the Sales people and demo it tomorrow.
	This will be the first version and they will give you feedback on how
	to proceed.

Technical:
	A record of sales (ROS) file is a date-/store-prefixed file as 

	  	    august-south_branch-2011.ros
 
       in CSV format with multiple lines of the type

              ITEM, SOLD_THIS_MONTH, PROJECTED_INCOME_BY_SALES_OF_ITEM

       However, The last line in each .ros is a grand total for that month on the actual 
       income that store had for that month

       	      TOTAL_INCOME

Task:
	You are to write an erlang program that reads multiple ROS's and outputs discrepancies
	found between projected income and TOTAL_INCOME.

	There are 4 .ros files available for you to test your program with.



 Think about:
       - what if the .ros internal format changes in the future?
       - will the analysis requirement change in the future?

Background:
	Having shown the PoC for the Sales department during a lunch break,
	the Sales people seemed happy.
	This seemed to be what they wanted, of course there where some murmurs
	of "why don't we use Excel instead", besides this, one additional specific feature
	was required.
	The head of Sales also agreed on defining a user acceptance test to seal the definition
	of done..

Technical:

	The additional feature was the output of the result

	 - The result of an analysis must be output to a file named according 
	   to the following scheme
  
             analysis_result_${DIRECTORY_ANALYZED}.txt

	   
	   This means, that if the sales people run the program on a 
	   directory called ros_winter_2011/
	   the result is output to a file called

 	     analysis_result_ros__winter_2011.txt

 	   Where the content of the file is grouped by two headers
	   
	     'PASSED_FILES:'

          and 

 	     'FAILED_FILES:'

	  each line under the heading 'PASSED_FILES:' is the name of the file
	  where the projected sum and total sum matches.

	  each lin under the heading 'FAILED_FILES:' is the name of the file
	  where the projected sum and total sum did not match.
	  On the failed files, add the cause to why it did not match.
	  
	  Example: A directory named RosFiles/ contains the following .ros files
                   2012-01-a.ros <--- OK
		   2012-02-a.ros <--- OK
		   2012-03-a.ros <--- Not okay
		   2012-01-b.ros <--- OK
		   2012-02-b.ros <--- Not okay
		   2012-03-b.ros <----Not okay
         
          Thus running the program with this directory as input, the result
	  should be a file called

	  	 
             analysis_result_RosFiles.txt

	 containing

	     PASSED_FILES:
	     2012-01-a.ros
	     2012-02-a.ros
	     2012-01-b.ros
	     
	     FAILED_FILES:
	     2012-03-a.ros,cause for failure
	     2012-02-b.ros,cause for failure
	     2012-03-b.ros,cause for failure

	You where given a bunch of files for this, put into a directory 
	user_acceptance_test/ together with a file which holds the exact
	expected result, but named user_acceptance_test.txt

Task:
	Add the extra feature, so that you pass the user acceptance test
	by reading the files from the directory and your output file
	analysis_result_user_acceptance_test.txt contains the same 
	as the file user_acceptance_test.txt

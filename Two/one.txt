Background:
	You work for a medium sized Software Company focusing on delivering
	online training platforms for education withing different sectors. 
	
	A dynamic platform base is being outlined and you are part of the
	small task force for this.

	The idea is to deploy a generic server with plug-in capabilities
	which are controlled by a simple socket interface. 
	

Technical:

	A first PoC that starts up, opens a port on 50001 and receives
	the possible commands, with following result

	bind $TYPE $FILE - declare that input and output is processed through $FILE
	unbind $TYPE - removes declaration
	list bind - lists all bindings

	open $PORT $TYPE - opens a port on which all sent/received data is processed 
                           through the $TYPE binding
	close $PORT - closes the port which processed data through a specific $TYPE
	list port - lists all user opened ports

	Should be fully tested.
